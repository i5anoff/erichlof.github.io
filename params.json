{"name":"Hobby 3D Game Programming with Three.js","tagline":"Live Examples","body":"   This webpage, hosted by GitHub, is the companion live example page to my blog: 3dGameProgramming.blogspot.com\r\n\r\n   You will be able to view all the examples/demos that were created and discussed on my blog.  And because I have stored all the game project files and source code here at GitHub they will serve the files to you.  That means you can try out the example code snippets and games for yourself, without having to save any files on your computer.  Just click the links to try the code examples.  \r\n\r\n   If you like what you see, you can then go <here> and find the corresponding folder for that example/game and download the source code to your computer.  Then you may edit and play around with it to your heart's content.  Enjoy!\r\n\r\n[September 2013](BlogExamples/September2013/example01.html)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
