{"name":"Hobby 3D Game Programming with Three.js","tagline":"Live Examples","body":"   This webpage, hosted by GitHub, is the companion live example page to my blog:\r\n[3dGameProgramming.blogspot.com](http://3dGameProgramming.blogspot.com)\r\n\r\n   You will be able to view all the examples/demos that were created and discussed on my blog.  And because I have stored all the game project files and source code here at GitHub they will serve the files to you.  That means you can try out the example code snippets and games for yourself, without having to save any files on your computer.  Just click the links below to try the code examples.  \r\n\r\n   If you like what you see, you can then go to [BlogExamples](https://github.com/erichlof/erichlof.github.io/tree/master/BlogExamples) code repository and find the corresponding folder for that example/game.  Then download the source code and associated files for that particular project to your computer.  When that's done, you may edit and play around with it to your heart's content.  Enjoy!\r\n\r\n[September 2013](https://github.com/erichlof/erichlof.github.io/blob/master/BlogExamples/September2013/GITHOSTEDexample01.html)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
