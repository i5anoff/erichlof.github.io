#3D Game Programming with Three.js
==================
This is the Project Files and Source Code repository for my blog:
<http://3dGameProgramming.blogspot.com>

You will be able to view and download all the files that were created or discussed on my blog.  And because I have stored all the game project files and source code here at GitHub, they will serve the files to you.  That means you can try out the example code snippets and games for yourself, without having to save any files on your computer.  Just go to <http://erichlof.github.io> and click the links to try the code examples.  

If you like what you see, go to: <https://github.com/erichlof/erichlof.github.io/tree/master/BlogExamples> and find the corresponding folder for that example/game.  Then download the source code and associated files for that project to your computer.  When that's done, you may edit and play around with it to your heart's content.  Enjoy!
