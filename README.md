==================
This is a Project File and Source Code repository for my blog:
3dgameprogramming.blogspot.com

This webpage is hosted by GitHub.  You will be able to view and download all the files that were created or discussed on my blog.  And because I have stored all the game project files and source code here at GitHub, they will serve the files to you.  That means you can try out the example code snippets and games for yourself, without having to save any files on your computer.  Just click the links to try the code examples.  

If you like what you see, you can then go to the corresponding folder for that example/game and download the source code to your computer.  Then you may edit and fiddle with it to your heart's content.  Enjoy!
